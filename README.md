Music superhero tool (prototype) that converts sounds from the microphone (with WAD) into sheet music with Vexflow. There was supposed to be a node.js server with a mongodb database for saving the music but it isn't done yet.

Note that this is just a toy! If you're serious about music you might try something like Intelliscore.
