Music superhero tool (prototype) that converts sounds from the microphone (with WAD) into sheet music. I should probably combine this with something like https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/The-VexFlow-Tutorial

There was supposed to be a node.js server with a mongodb database for saving your music but it isn't done yet.
